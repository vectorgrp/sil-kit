Developer Guide
=============================

The following sections explain, how to consume the Vector |ProductName| library in your own application and how to use the |ProductName| API to communicate with other participants of a simulation.

Getting the |ProductName|
--------------------------

Precompiled |ProductName| packages are regularly released on GitHub (`https://github.com/vectorgrp/sil-kit/releases <https://github.com/vectorgrp/sil-kit/releases>`_).
If you need to build the library yourself, take a look at the readme file of the repository's root folder.

Architecture
------------

The |ProductName| implements a layered architecture:

Prerequisites for Compilation
-----------------------------

* For Windows:
    * Visual Studio 2017 (toolset v141) and higher
* For Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:
    * GCC 8 **or**
    * Clang


Writing your first |ProductName| application
--------------------------------------------

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with `CMake (https://cmake.org) <https://cmake.org>`_ and C++.

Using the |ProductName| package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |ProductName| distribution contains a self-contained and deployable installation in the *SilKit* directory.
The CMake build configuration required is exported to ``SilKit/lib/cmake/SilKit`` and defines the ``SilKit::SilKit`` target.

From CMake this can be consumed via the ``find_package(SilKit CONFIG)`` mechanism.
For example, the following CMakeLists.txt imports the |ProductName| library based on its file system path.

.. literalinclude::
   ../code-samples/simple/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake
   :lines: 22-31

Properties, like include directories and compile flags, are automatically handled by the imported target.
If you use another method to build your software you can directly use the ``SilKit/include`` and ``SilKit/lib`` directories for C++ headers and libraries.

.. _sec:developer-simple:

A simple Publish / Subscribe application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We'll create a simple, self-contained |ProductName| application that uses :doc:`Publish/Subscribe</api/services/pubsub>` to exchange user-defined data between two participants.
In our C++ file ``simple.cpp``, we include the headers and define namespaces and constants:

.. literalinclude::
   ../code-samples/simple/simple.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 22-31

|ProductName| participants are created with a configuration that is used to change certain aspects of the simulation without recompiling the application.

.. admonition:: Note

  |ProductName| applications should be able to run without a configuration file.
  However, applications should allow users to provide one in case they want to reconfigure the behavior of the application (see :ref:`The Participant Configuration File<sec:participant-config>` for details).


This can be done by loading an existing :ref:`YAML file<sec:sil-kit-config-yaml>`.
Here, we use the configuration file ``simple.yaml`` to configure a logger that logs all error messages to a file:

.. literalinclude::
   ../code-samples/simple/simple.yaml
   :language: yaml

We load it in the main function of our code::

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        auto config = SilKit::Config::ParticipantConfigurationFromFile("simple.yaml");
        // TODO: Use config to create participants
    }

The application will run two participants concurrently, each in its own thread.
One thread will act as a publisher by sending a test string to its subscribers:

.. literalinclude::
   ../code-samples/simple/simple.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 33-69

Initially, the simulation is joined by creating the participant called "PublisherParticipant".
This properly initializes the |ProductName| library; enables the instantiation of :doc:`Services</api/services/lifecycle>` and offers access to the :doc:`Lifecycle Service</api/services/lifecycle>`, which controls the orchestration of our simulation.
Next, we create a :cpp:class:`publisher<SilKit::Services::PubSub::IDataPublisher>` for the ``DataService`` topic.
Later, we subscribe to the same topic name in our subscriber to enable communication between the participants.
The actual simulation is performed in the simulation task.
This is a callback that is executed by the |ProductName| runtime whenever the simulation time advances.
This callback has to be registered with the time synchronization service's :cpp:func:`SetSimulationStepHandler()<SilKit::Services::Orchestration::ITimeSyncService::SetSimulationStepHandler()>`.
We hand over the publisher object in the capture list of our simulation task and use it to send data through its :cpp:func:`Publish()<SilKit::Services::PubSub::IDataPublisher::Publish()>` method.

The subscriber runs in its own thread, too:

.. literalinclude::
   ../code-samples/simple/simple.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 71-102

The setup is similar to the publisher, except that we instantiate a :cpp:class:`subscriber<SilKit::Services::PubSub::IDataSubscriber>` interface.
This allows us to register a :cpp:func:`SetDataMessageHandler()<SilKit::Services::PubSub::IDataSubscriber::SetDataMessageHandler()>` callback to receive data value updates.
The simulation task has to be defined, even though no simulation work is performed.

We extend our main function to spawn both threads and join them again once finished.
Also, we use a try-catch block here to get proper error handling e.g., if the configuration file cannot be loaded.

.. literalinclude::
   ../code-samples/simple/simple.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :lines: 104-127

The application is built with CMake on the command line (from a build directory) by calling ``cmake ..`` to generate and then build via ``cmake --build .``.
A more convenient way is to open the folder in an IDE with CMake support.
To run this sample, copy the shared library files (e.g., on Windows the ``SilKit.dll``, ``SilKitd.dll`` from ``SilKit/bin``) and the ``simple.yaml`` next to the compiled executable.

Running the simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our sample needs the utility processes :ref:`sec:util-registry` and :ref:`sec:util-system-controller` to run.
The registry is required for participant discovery.
The :ref:`sec:util-system-controller` takes the participant names as command line arguments, initializes the connected participants and starts the simulation until the return key is pressed.
For convenience and to reduce code duplication, these utility programs are implemented in separate executables and distributed in binary forms.

The final simulation setup can be run through the following commands:

.. code-block::
      
      # Start the Middleware Registry
      ./sil-kit-registry.exe

      # Start the System Controller and tell it to wait for PublisherParticipant and SubscriberParticipant
      ./sil-kit-system-controller.exe PublisherParticipant SubscriberParticipant

      # Start the application running the two participants
      # Make sure that the SilKit.dll and simple.yaml are available 
      ./SampleSilKit.exe

Platform support
-----------------------

SIL Kit provides three tiers of platform support

.. list-table:: Support Tiers
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Tier 1
     - Essential targets. Continuously tested and
       official binary packages are provided.
   * - Tier 2
     - Officially supported targets. Continuously tested
       but NO binary packages are provided
   * - Tier 3
     - | Targets for which we have (limited) build support but which
       | are not continuously tested and no packages are provided

A platform is hereby defined by the combination of the used operating system (OS), the CPU architecture (eg. x86 or ARM64) and the compiler/toolchain used.
For example,  `Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 Clang 10`.

SIL Kit should compile and run on
any POSIX platform. If you have feedback for different targets or platforms not listed here,
please report them using GitHub Issues. Thanks!

A target may be upgraded to
`Tier 1` once we have continuous testing for it in place and we have binary
packages available for it.
