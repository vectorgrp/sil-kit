Running a Vector |ProductName| system is supported by several utilities.
The **Registry** is a mandatory part of the |ProductName| integrated middleware.
It is needed to establish the connections between simulation participants at the start of a simulation.
The **System Controller** implements a simulation-wide state handling.
It allows to provide the participant names that are required for the simulation to start via command-line arguments.   
The **Monitor** is provided for convenience. 
It implements a simulation-wide state tracking and prints this information to the console.
The System Controller and the Monitor serve as reference implementations for their respective usage scenarios.
Users are free to implement their own versions of these utilities.

.. _sec:util-registry:

sil-kit-registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract
    The ``sil-kit-registry`` enables discovery between |ProductName| participants. 
    It is needed for Vector |ProductName| simulations.
Source location
    ``Utilities/SilKitRegistry``
Requirements
    None
Parameters
    * ``-v, --version``                            
      Get version info.
    * ``-h, --help``                               
      Show the help of the |ProductName| Registry.
    * ``-u, --listen-uri <silkitUri>``             
      The ``silkit://`` URI the registry should listen on. Defaults to ``silkit://localhost:8500``.
    * ``-g, --generate-configuration <path>``      
      Generate a configuration file which includes the URI the registry listens on.
    * ``-d, --dashboard-uri <uri>``                
      The ``http://`` URI of the |ProductName| Dashboard to which data is sent.
    * ``-l, --log <level>``                        
      Log to stdout with level ``off``, ``critical``, ``error``, ``warn``, ``info``, ``debug``, or ``trace``. Defaults to ``info``.
    * ``-c, --registry-configuration <filePath>``  
      The configuration read from this file overrides the values specified on the command line.
    * ``-s, --use-signal-handler``                 
      Terminate when an OS signal is received. **Deprecated:** Since v4.0.53, this is the default behavior.
Usage Example
    .. code-block:: powershell

       # Start the SIL Kit Registry
       sil-kit-registry
Notes
    * The |ProductName| Registry is packaged in the ``SilKit/bin`` directory.
    * The |ProductName| Registry must be started before other |ProductName| participants,
      either with this process or using the :cpp:func:`StartListening()<SilKit::Vendor::Vector::ISilKitRegistry::StartListening()>` API.
    * When the port ``0`` is specified in the URI (``--listen-uri``) the operating system will choose a random port for the registry.
      This port is used in the generated configuration file (``--generate-configuration``) for use in CI environments.
    * When the file specified by ``--generate-configuration`` was created by the registry, it is guaranteed that the registry process
      has completed initialization and is ready to accept incoming connections of |ProductName| participants.
    * The registry will run if either binding to the TCP socket, or the Domain socket, or both succeeds.
      If only TCP or Domain sockets are used, because one of the bindings failed for some reason, a warning will be logged.
      It will exit with an error if neither is available.
    * The |ProductName| Dashboard is experimental and might be changed or removed in future versions of the |ProductName|.
         
.. _sec:util-system-controller:

sil-kit-system-controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract
    The ``sil-kit-system-controller`` defines which participants are required for a simulation.
    Coordinated participants will wait until all required participants joined a simulation before they progress their state.
    Autonomous participants progress their state without any dependencies to other participants.
Source location
    ``Utilities/SilKitSystemController``
Requirements
    The ``sil-kit-system-controller`` needs a running ``sil-kit-registry`` to connect to.
    Furthermore, it requires a list of participant names that are needed to start the simulation as input.
Parameters
    * ``-v, --version``                                
      Get version info.
    * ``-h, --help``                                   
      Show the help of the |ProductName| System Controller.
    * ``-u, --connect-uri <silkitUri>``                
      The registry URI to connect to. Defaults to ``silkit://localhost:8500``.
    * ``-n, --name <participantName>``                 
      The participant name used to take part in the simulation. Defaults to ``SystemController``.
    * ``-c, --configuration <filePath>``               
      Path to the Participant configuration YAML or JSON file. 
      Note that the format was changed in v3.6.11. 
      Cannot be used together with the ``--log`` option.
    * ``-l, --log <level>``                            
      Log to stdout with level ``trace``, ``debug``, ``warn``, ``info``, ``error``, ``critical`` or ``off``. 
      Defaults to ``info`` if the ``--configuration`` option is not specified. 
      Cannot be used together with the ``--configuration`` option.
    * ``-ni, --non-interactive``                       
      Never prompt the user. *Deprecated:* Since v4.0.53, this is the default behavior.
    * ``<participantName1>, <participantName2> ...``
      Names of participants to wait for before starting the simulation.
Usage Example
    .. code-block:: powershell
    
       # Start the SIL Kit System Controller and wait for 'Participant1' and 'Participant2':
       sil-kit-system-controller Participant1 Participant2
Notes
    * The distribution package contains the ``sil-kit-system-controller`` in the ``SilKit/bin/`` directory.

.. _sec:util-monitor:

sil-kit-monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract
    The ``sil-kit-monitor`` visualizes the states of the participants of a |ProductName| simulation.
Source location
    ``Utilities/SilKitMonitor``
Requirements
    Requires a running ``sil-kit-registry`` to connect to.
Parameters
    * ``-v, --version``                           
      Get version info.
    * ``-h, --help``                              
      Show the help of the |ProductName| Monitor.
    * ``-u, --connect-uri <silkitUri>``           
      The registry URI to connect to. Defaults to ``silkit://localhost:8500``.
    * ``-n, --name <participantName>``            
      The participant name used to take part in the simulation. Defaults to ``SystemMonitor``.
    * ``-c, --configuration <filePath>``          
      Path to the Participant configuration YAML or JSON file.
    * ``-a, --autonomous``                       
      Run with an autonomous lifecycle.
    * ``-r, --coordinated``                       
      Run with a coordinated lifecycle.
    * ``-s, --sync``                              
      Run with virtual time synchronization.
Usage Example
    .. code-block:: powershell
   
       # Start the SIL Kit Monitor
       sil-kit-monitor
Notes
    * The distribution package contains the ``sil-kit-monitor`` in the ``SilKit/bin/`` directory.
    * The ``sil-kit-monitor`` represents a passive participant in a |ProductName| system. 
      It can therefore be (re)started at any time.
