Please use only GitHub Flavored Markdown when writing the version notes.

The section below shows an example of a version note for an _released_ version.
There is usually only one of those (the latest), otherwise someone forgot to
update the date.

If the delivery date is not fixed yet, replace the date (i.e., `2042-06-09`)
with the string `UNRELEASED`. The heading will look like this:

    # [6.9.1] - UNRELEASED

-->


# [6.9.1] - 2042-06-09

> # Important: No More Ubuntu 16.04 Packages
>
> Since Ubuntu 16.04 is outdated by about 35 years now, we won't support it anymore.
