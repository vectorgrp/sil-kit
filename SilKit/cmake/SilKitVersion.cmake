# SIL Kit Versioning:
# * Major and minor release number is configured here. The patch number should not be changed here; it will be set by 
#   the Jenkins workflow to the master branch's build number for packaging (cmake -SILKIT_BUILD_NUMBER).
# * Major and minor release number, as well as the sprint number are encoded into Version.hpp and compiled into the library,
#   they will be accessible from public headers.
