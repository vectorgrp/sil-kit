/*! SIL Kit Extensions
 * 
 * The extension mechanism consists of two parts:
 *   1.) loading dynamic, shared library (ie, *.so or *.dll), and
 *   2.) the extension points derived from ISilKitExtension.
 *
 * To create an extension for use inside of SILKIT create an interface as a
 * subclass of ISilKitExtension, and implement the interface in a
 * shared library.
 *
 * For implementing an extension in shared module form, refer to the
 * SilKitExtensionApi/ folder.
