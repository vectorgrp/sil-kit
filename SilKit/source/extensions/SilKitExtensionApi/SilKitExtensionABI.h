/*! SILKIT Extension Libraries
 *
 * This header defines the shared library interface in terms of C symbols, which
 * allow creation of SILKIT extensions as dynamic libraries.
 * You have to implement the C functions listed below in your own library.
 *
 * Version Compatibility:
 * - SILKIT version must match, otherwise the extension will not be loaded.
 * - newer versions of SilKitExtensionDescriptor must not change the existing struct
 *   layout, but may append to it.
