# Contributing to the SIL Kit Project

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to the SIL Kit
open source project.
Since January 2026, SIL Kit is engineered and maintained by Vector and Synopsys in collaboration.

We are sorry, but at the moment, we do not accept external contributions until we have established a contribution process.
However, you can contribute to the open-source project by creating an issue to discuss bugs or feature requests in public. 

We're working behind the scenes to get this ready in the future.
Until then, we would kindly ask you to not open pull requests.

We will update this document when we are ready for your submissions.
Thank you and stay tuned!
