# Contributing to Vector SIL Kit

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Vector SIL Kit
open source project.

We are sorry, but at the moment, we do not accept external contributions until
we have established a contribution process. We're working behind the scenes to
get this ready in the future. Until then, we would kindly ask you to not open pull
requests.

We will update this document when we are ready for your submissions.
Thank you and stay tuned!
